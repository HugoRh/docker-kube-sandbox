# docker-kube-sandbox for RPI3
Fork from [mchebitou/docker-kube-sandbox](https://github.com/mchebitou/docker-kube-sandbox)

Docker in Docker image with shellinabox, kubectl and git based on docker image https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/hrhein/docker-kube-sandbox

## Why?
Recently I had to build a lab for initiating new users to the use of Docker and Kubernetes, I needed a quick way to give those users access to a ready to use environment with all the necessary tools and enough security to make sure they don't break anything.
To make this image I took [fhuegli/docker-shellinabox](https://github.com/fhuegli/docker-shellinabox),
rebased it on [Docker official image](https://hub.docker.com/r/arm32v6/docker/) and adapted it to suit my need.

## Install on Kubernetes

    $ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/

Default credentials to be used for login are :

    username: docker
    password: secret
